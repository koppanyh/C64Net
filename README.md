# C64Net
Repo for Commodore 64 Arduino Internet Project

This project is being made for my entry in the University of La Verne's Inaugural Mini Maker Fair.

and a Linux laptop by bitbanging the cassette protocol.

Many of these files are simply proof of concept and aren't actually used for the main project.
